- **Phase 3 Approach:** Configure Pi-hole to resolve `*.newton.local` to server IP
  - Add wildcard entry via Pi-hole web interface or directly in `pihole/etc/custom.list`:
    - Format: `.newton.local 192.168.0.243` (wildcard for all subdomains)
  - Traefik will handle routing based on subdomain (e.g., `pihole.newton.local`)
- **Alternative Options:**
  - Router DNS entries for `*.newton.local`
  - `/etc/hosts` entries on each device
  - mDNS/Bonjour for automatic discovery

### Port Requirements

- **Phase 1:** Port 53 (DNS), 80 (Pi-hole web)
- **Phase 2:** Port 3000 (Homepage) - temporary
- **Phase 3:** Port 80, 443 (Traefik) - all services via Traefik
- **Future:** Only Traefik ports exposed, all services internal
